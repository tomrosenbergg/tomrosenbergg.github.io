In the fall of 1988 a Texas high school fielded the football team that many consider the greatest ever, yet chances are good you have never heard their story. What Carter Lost, directed by [Adam Hootnick](https://www.adamhootnick.com/) for ESPN Films' 30 for 30 series, is the saga of that team, the Dallas Carter Cowboys. I was an archival producer for the project.
