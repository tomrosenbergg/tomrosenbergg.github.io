Developed by architects Ana Filipović and Philipp Mecke, A Place of One's Own is an installation for the park of Kranich Museum in Hessenburg. Visitors' movements activate motion sensors connected to glass sound sculptures inviting discovery and contemplation. I worked with Ana Filipović and Philipp Mecke to develop a video that would document this piece and convey the sensorial experience of engaging with the work.
