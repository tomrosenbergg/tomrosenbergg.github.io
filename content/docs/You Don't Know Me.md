**You Don't Know Me**

2013 / 10 min

Eccentric Texas preacher Ace Elliot lives alone in a purple cabin next to I-35, one of the USA's largest thoroughfares. His property is covered with dozens of bright, homemade signs bearing messages of apocalypse and redemption. Although thousands of drivers pass him everyday, few stop to hear him preach. Ace opens up about his past, and then performs an Elvis song.
