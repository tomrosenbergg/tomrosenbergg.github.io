Destination: Team USA is a feature-length branded documentary I produced for United Airlines and Tribeca Digital Studios. The film follows five Olympic hopefuls who face personal and athletic obstacles as they strive to make Team USA, dreaming of Olympic glory. I worked with Director [Adam Hootnick](https://www.adamhootnick.com/) to research, develop, and pitch the project and then oversaw the production, which involved filming in six countries over five months.
