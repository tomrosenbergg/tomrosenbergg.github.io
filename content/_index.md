I am a US filmmaker based in Berlin with diverse experience producing [documentaries]( {{< ref "docs/Destination Team USA.md" >}}), educational films, and [branded content]( {{< ref "docs/Omio.md" >}}). My  background includes work as a DP and editor on a variety of [commercials]( {{< ref "docs/Travel Out of the Ordinary.md" >}}), artist videos, shorts, television, and features. Additionally, I have taught film courses and workshops to graduate and undergraduate students. Currently, I am producing a children’s [animated film]( {{< ref "docs/Daniel's Story.md" >}}) for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. 

As a director, I have made several award-winning short [documentaries]( {{< ref "docs/Nothing Human.md" >}}) that have screened at major international festivals, including Locarno, HotDocs, Art of the Real, the Viennale, and CPH:DOX. I was also named one of Filmmaker Magazine’s "25 New Faces of Independent Film." Together with Egyptian filmmaker Marouan Omara, I am developing a [narrative feature film]( {{< ref "docs/Only Night Remembers.md" >}}).
